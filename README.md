Lab 1 for MAN 337 Performance and Sports Analytics

#1: Find which teams are better at home than away.
From teams that played more than 12 games, the obvious good home team was Hungary, who averaged 4 goals and an 83.3% win rate at home compared to a 0% win rate away with an average of only one goal. Some other notable teams that had good home records and bad away records were (formerly) Yugoslavia (75% home win rate to 11.8% win rate away) and (formerly) the Soviet Union (72.2% home win rate to 15.4% away win rate). Each of these teams had a similar amount of games played away and at home.

#2: Which country scored the second most goals in 2018?
Error in parsing the strings in Home and Away by the ordering of the characters. By inspection, Sweden scored the second most goals with 24 total, with USA first and Germany in third.

#3: Which team is the most exciting to watch in the past 10 years?
I would argue that Brazil has been the most exciting to watch in the past 10 years. They rank 6th in home attendance and score the most goals per home game in the top 6 range. What I found to be impressive was that they average over 50,000 people for 99 games, which is easily the largest sample, which means that people have consistently come back to watch that team play.
